Hackathons are great way to promote innovation among students by bringing in cutting-edge problem statements. See this for a good explanation.     <br/>     <br/>     Your only constraint is: You only have 30 hours.   </p>   <h2>NIT Surat's Premier Hackathon.</h2>   <p>     Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch - these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots. So prepare yourself for a weekend filled with learning new technologies, building amazing products and making new friends all within the span of 30 hours.   </p>",
